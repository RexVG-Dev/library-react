        "description": "A quilt is about home, daily life, where you've been and who you've known. It's about stories and history. A quilt is imbued with the power to rediscover memories, open up conversations and bring people together. For Julius Arthur of House of Quinn, this idea extends into our design ethos bringing together stories and narratives to create everyday items and objects. Modern Quilting highlights how traditional quilting and sewing techniques can be utilized to create contemporary items and objects for the home. Showcasing 20 stunning projects, Julius shows you the beauty of renewing textiles and materials by giving them a new life. Contemporary quilting honors the traditional processes but allows you to create the rules of what you want to create. With a more creative and free approach to working with textiles, quilts and making, Julius guides the reader through four skill based workshops, and techniques, such as stitching, quilting, collage and mark making, before opening up into a range of modern quilt-based projects that can be created from combining these fundamental skills. With stunning photography and step-by-step illustrations throughout, fall in love with this age-old craft and discover how to create meaningful items for your own living spaces, places and daily rituals.",
